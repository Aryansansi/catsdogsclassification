## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CatDogClassifier.git
cd CatDogClassifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Place your cat and dog images in the following directory structure:

```plaintext
cats_and_dogs/
├── train/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
├── validation/
│   ├── cats/
│   └── dogs/
└── test/
    ├── cats/
    └── dogs/
```

## Model Architecture
The model uses transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture, followed by a GlobalAveragePooling layer and two dense layers.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is augmented using the `ImageDataGenerator` class from TensorFlow to improve the model's generalization.

## Training
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks are used to prevent overfitting.

## Requirements
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Inference
After training, the model weights are saved. If the weights file is present, the model loads the weights and performs inference on the test set, displaying the predictions.

## Results
The model's accuracy and loss during training and validation are plotted and displayed.
